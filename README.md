The team circuit board pins files, including both the schematic/board and Gerber files.
Contact me if you have any questions.

Board file images were rendered with the fabulous ZofzPCB tool (available free online) and the colorswere adjusted to accurately represent the ENIG plating over the pads of the red PCBS (for the teams cardinal and gold colors).

Yes, the trace that goes through the switch in that pad is unintentional but, as that connection is shorted, anyways, when it is turned off, it electrically has no impact. It can be safely and completely ignored.
